Nearly line-for-line port of Clay's example SDL3 renderer, alongside the odin + raylib website demo.

The code is far from idiomatic, the biggest issue is the use of multipointers for fonts.

The code is a bit dense since the website is pretty big, but you might be able to diff against the raylib version to see the changes.
